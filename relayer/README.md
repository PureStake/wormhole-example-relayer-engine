## Relayer App

# This is not ready yet, use relayer-engine as a library instead

This folder will allow running the relayer engine as a stand alone application.

- Install plugins packaged as npm depdendencies, optionally override their configuration, 
- Provide the relayer engine config for each supported environment (mainnet, localhost, etc.) 
- Run the relayer, redis and spy in a production set up
